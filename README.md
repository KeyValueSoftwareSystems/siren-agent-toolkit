# Siren Agent Toolkit

The Siren Agent Toolkit enables popular AI agent frameworks including OpenAI's Agent SDK, LangChain, and Vercel's AI SDK to integrate with Siren's API's. This library provides seamless access to Siren's messaging, template management, user management, workflow automation, and webhook configuration capabilities.

The library includes support for both Python and TypeScript and is built directly on top of Siren's official SDKs. Refer to the [Python](/python) and [TypeScript](/typescript) packages for detailed documentation and examples.
